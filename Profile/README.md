# :open_book: About The Project
  Our team was inspired by the issue of limited stock or options available to most people who only require them for a short period or specific events. As a solution, we developed an e-commerce-based rental application called **"Kalla Employee Management (Barang Kita)"** that shares similarities with traditional e-commerce platforms but includes options for returning items according to agreed-upon timeframes. Our application utilizes Machine Learning to validate uploaded item listings with inputted categories, thereby avoiding clickbait often encountered on other e-commerce platforms.
